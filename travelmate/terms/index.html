            <p>
                Before filing a legal claim, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@travelmate.app">support@travelmate.app</a> to attempt to resolve the dispute informally.
            </p>

            <h3>13.2 Arbitration Agreement</h3>
            <p>
                Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App shall be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except where prohibited by law. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit and uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury.
            </p>

            <h3>13.3 Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
                These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
            </p>

            <h3>13.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>
                You agree that disputes will be resolved on an individual basis only and not as a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.
            </p>

            <h3>14.1 Entire Agreement</h3>

                These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and TravelMate regarding the use of the App.
            </p>

            <h3>14.2 Severability</h3>
            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
            </p>

            <h3>14.3 Waiver</h3>
            <p>
                Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.
            </p>

            <h3>14.4 Assignment</h3>
            <p>
                You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your account without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms without restriction.
            </p>

            <h3>14.5 Force Majeure</h3>
            <p>
                We are not liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, or internet service failures.
            </p>

            <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>

            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we make changes, we will:

            <ul>
                <li>Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page</li>
                <li>Notify you through the App or via email for material changes</li>
                <li>Provide you with an opportunity to review the changes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Your continued use of TravelMate after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the App and delete your account.
